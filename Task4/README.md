Task 4
Write a test using pytest, which would validate command-line application upper_case_file. You will find test data in data folder. It contains input files and reference files. For example, betty.input.txt file contents, when processed with the application, should match betty.output.txt. Cover ALL 10 files with tests

Added folder 'tests' to store all testing relevant files into it. Moved test data to 'tests\input_data'. After running test output data of upper_case_file.py should be inside 'tests\output_data' directory. Moved test data to 'tests\input_data'. After running test output data of upper_case_file.py should be inside 'tests\output_data' directory. If adding more inputs, they should have the word "input" in it (e. g. betty.input.txt or betty (input).txt)
